Technically this app is builded using flutter_bloc for state management, bloc_test for unit testing in the bloc part, and PATROL for UI test and integration testing!

You can find information about how to setup PATROL in you computer here! https://patrol.leancode.co/

but in case, here are a couple of videos showing up the tests with Patrol!
